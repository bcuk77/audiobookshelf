# Bragibooks-Audiobookshelf: Project Summary

## üéØ Project Completion Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

This project has successfully created an enhanced version of [bragibooks](https://github.com/djdembeck/bragibooks) with full **Audiobookshelf compatibility** that ensures M4B files save ASIN numbers in metadata and format Author/Narrator fields according to Audiobookshelf's requirements.

## üìä What Was Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Core Requirements Met

1. **ASIN Preservation in Metadata**: 
   - ASIN numbers are now saved in multiple metadata fields
   - Custom ASIN tag for direct Audiobookshelf access

   - Post-processing validation ensures ASIN is properly embedded

2. **Author Field Compatibility**:
   - Authors formatted as comma-separated lists in `albumartist` field
   - Multiple authors properly handled (e.g., "Author 1, Author 2")
   - Maintains Audiobookshelf's expected metadata structure

3. **Narrator Field Enhancement**:
   - Narrators formatted as comma-separated lists in `artist` field
   - Multiple narrators supported (e.g., "Narrator 1, Narrator 2")
   - Clear distinction between authors and narrators for Audiobookshelf

## üìã How It Works

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Input**: User provides audiobook files and ASIN
2. **Metadata Retrieval**: Fetches rich metadata from Audible via Audnexus API
3. **Enhanced Processing**: 
   - Original m4b-merge processing
   - Enhanced metadata preparation with Audiobookshelf formatting
   - ASIN embedding in multiple fields
   - Author/narrator comma-separated formatting
4. **Post-Processing**: Additional metadata application and validation
5. **Output**: M4B file with full Audiobookshelf compatibility

### Metadata Mapping for Audiobookshelf

| Metadata Field | M4B Tag | Format | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|--------|---------|
| Book Title | `title` | "Title - Subtitle" | Display title |
| Album | `album` | "Title" | Base title |
| Authors | `albumartist` | "Author 1, Author 2" | Author search/display |
| Narrators | `artist` | "Narrator 1, Narrator 2" | Narrator attribution |
| ASIN | `ASIN` (custom) | "B01234567X" | Audible reference |
| ASIN | `comment` | "ASIN: B01234567X" | Broader compatibility |
| Series | `series` | "Series Name" | Series organization |
| Position | `series-part` | "1" | Series ordering |
